    processBrief: `Immersion dyeing is a technique for dyeing fabrics and other materials using natural dyes that are gotten from Avocado-pits. It involves fully immersing the material to be dyed in a dye bath made from Avocado-pits. This is a simple and easy method that works well for dyeing small items or those with a uniform color.
`,
    detail:`To prepare the dye bath for immersion dyeing, you will need to:`,
    process: [
      `Gather your natural dye sources: Avocado-pits will be garthered in required quantity to be able to get the amount and  concentration needed.`,
      `Extract the dye: The Avocado-pits will need to be prepared to extract the dye. This can be done by boiling, steeping, or macerating it. The Immersion deying method is suitable for fabrics because of the sharpness and clear color of dye that is gotten from its source, Avocado-pits.`,
      `Prepare the dye bath: Once the dye has been extracted, it can be used to create the dye bath. The dye bath should be large enough to fully immerse the material to be dyed. The dye bath can be prepared by adding the extracted dye to a pot of water and heating it until it reaches the desired temperature.`,
      `
Add the material to be dyed: Once the dye bath is prepared, the material to be dyed can be added to the pot. It is important to fully immerse the material in the dye bath and to stir it occasionally to ensure an even application of the dye.`,
`Dye the material: The material should be left in the dye bath for a period of time to allow the dye to fully penetrate the fibers. The dyeing time will depend on the type of dye source and the desired color.`,
`Rinse and dry the dyed material: Once the dyeing process is complete, the dyed material should be rinsed thoroughly to remove any excess dye. It should then be dried completely before being used or stored.`
    ],
    conclusionBrief:`Overall, immersion dyeing is a simple and effective technique for dyeing fabrics and other materials using Avocado-pits. It is a good choice for dyeing small items or those with a uniform color.`,
